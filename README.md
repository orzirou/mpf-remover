# MpfRemover

## Summary

This application can delete easily MPF tags of exif.

## Why delete MPF

If the mpf tag exists in exif, Google Photos storage consumption cannot be reduced.  
It is possible to remove mpf tags using exiftool, but some people are not good at command line, so I made an application.
